### Featured Project

#### Real-Time Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a functional, real-time, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.

ðŸ”— **Live Demo:** https://iridescent-bublanina-965e58.netlify.app/

**Project Overview**
This application allows users to create or join a room and play against each other. The game state is synchronized in real-time, and the interface displays the game grid, player information, and the current game status.

**Technical Highlights**
The core of this project is a real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server using **Socket.IO**.

* **Server-Side**: The server, built with **Node.js** and **Express**, manages game rooms and player connections. It listens for events from clients (e.g., `createRoom`, `joinRoom`, `xMove`, `oMove`, `reset`) and emits messages to specific clients or all clients in a room.
* **Client-Side**: The front-end is a **React** application built with **Vite**. It connects to the Socket.IO server to send and receive game data. The socket instance is provided to all child components using a React Context, making it easily accessible without "prop drilling".
